# tfautograph

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- [![CRAN status](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/tfautograph)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tfautograph) -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This package implements autograph for R. 

It lets you use tensors in R control flow expressions like `if`, `while` and
`for` and automatically translates those expressions into tensorflow graphs. 

It is compatible with and tested against Tensorflow Versions 2.0, 1.15 and 1.14.
